Java enticed programmers with its attractive syntax, object-oriented capabilities, memory management, and, most importantly, portability. It means “Write-once run-anywhere”. Nonetheless, it provides support for primitive data types int, char, double, and float. Hence, it is not considered as a pure object-oriented programming language, at this moment we don't touch it in detail, we will cover this in upcoming blogs.",
