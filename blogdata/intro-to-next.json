  "content": "The ultimate tool for any React developer to learn and improve their own projects is, without a doubt, Next.js. Screen-Shot-2022-01-14-at-12.12.20-PM The NextJS.org Homepage  Whether I'm building a static site with interactivity like a blog, or a highly dynamic, full-stack project like a social media app, I almost always reach for Next.  The first reason for you to use Next is, as the banner headline states, because it's a React framework.  Think of it as a 'batteries-included' way to build your React applications, which gives you the simplicity of tools like Create React App, combined with a suite of other super powerful features.  Despite being a framework, Next.js keeps some of the React philosophy of being unopinionated. Next gives you features to improve your overall development experience but doesn't constrain the amount of options you can choose from.  In fact, given what Next makes possible for React apps, I would contend that it has really expanded the number of options available to you, if you need it.  You can get a more complete sense of everything Next.js apps are capable of by checking 100s of example Next.js projects at nextjs.org/examples: Screen-Shot-2022-01-14-at-1.56.57-PM Next.js Examples  There you can find examples on how to create the following Next (React) apps:      A blog using Markdown / MDX or Wordpress     An e-commerce app using Shopify     A site using content management systems like Contentful or Sanity     A full-stack project with GraphQL and Authentication  And tons more! Be sure to check out the full list to spark your imagination.",
